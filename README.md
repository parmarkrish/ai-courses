# AI Courses
My solutions to various AI Courses from Stanford, CMU, Berkeley and MIT.

## [Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.](https://github.com/parmarkrish/cs231n)
Essentially an intro to deep learning course taught in the lens of computer vision. \
Topics include backprop (computation graphs), optimization, how to properly train NNs, network visualization and generative models.

## [Stanford CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://github.com/parmarkrish/cs224n)
Covers word embeddings, approaches to train word embeddings (Word2vec), RNNs, LSTMs, machine translation, self-attention & transformers.

## [CMU Deep Learning Systems](https://github.com/parmarkrish/dlsys/)
Building out a PyTorch-like deep learning library called **Needle** (**ne**cessary **e**lements of **d**eep **le**arning). Implementation of autograd, many ML operators, NN library and NDArray CPU/CUDA backend.

## [Berkeley Deep Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/parmarkrish/deepul)
Covers various approaches such as autoregressive models (e.g, PixelCNN), flow models (e.g, RealNVP), latent variable models (e.g, VAE, VQ-VAE) and implicit models (GANs).

## [MIT EfficientML](https://github.com/parmarkrish/EfficientML)
Includes topics such as pruning/sparsity, quantization, neural architecture search and LLM optimization techniques (e.g, AWQ & SmoothQuant).
